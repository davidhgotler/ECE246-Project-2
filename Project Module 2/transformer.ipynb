    "### Tokenization (Patchifying an Image)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the transformer architecture, the input is partitioned into basic units called tokens. At the heart of the self-attention mechanism (which is the core of the transformer) is the ability to capture relationships between any two tokens in the input, enabling the discovery of **long-range dependencies**. For text, tokens typically represent consecutive characters. For simplicity, we can assume that each word in a sentence is a token.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, self-attention examines the relationship between each word and every other word in the sentence (including itself) to generate a new representation for that word based on the similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image domain, defining tokens is simpler. Given an image of size $H \\times W$, we first divide it into square patches of size $P \\times P$. Each patch is then flattened to obtain a vector, which becomes our token. The image is then represented by $N$ tokens, where\n",

    "### Self-Attention in Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous part, we obtained the tokens (image patches) that the transformer model takes as input. Transformer models operate by representing the information from each token based on its relation to every other token in the input. For instance, while processing the top-left patch (token 0), the model uses its relation with every other patch to obtain an updated representation for that patch. The same idea applies to text, where every token (word) in a sentence is processed by the transformer, taking into account the relationships between any pair of tokens. This mechanism is called **self-attention** and it enables the transformer to capture **long-term dependencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-attention layer is the most important component of the transformer architecture. Now, letâ€™s take a closer look at how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-attention represents every element in the input (tokens initially, and feature vectors for the deeper layers in the network) as a weighted sum of the representations of all other elements in the sequence. This is achieved by computing three vectors for every element:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key**: What a token offers to other tokens. (of length $d_k$)\n",
    "2. **Query**: What each token looks for in the other tokens. (of length $d_k$)\n",
    "3. **Value**: The representation of each token, which we sum over using the computed weights to get the final representations. (of length $d_v$)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the $i$-th element in the input sequence, the similarity score (weight) is computed by taking the dot product of its query vector $q_i$ with the key vectors of every token in the sequence (including itself):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_i = q_i \\cdot K^T\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K$ is the matrix containing the key vectors for all tokens in its rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "These scores are then scaled by the factor $ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}} $ to keep the variance of the dot product in check:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha'_i = \\frac{q_i \\cdot K^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a softmax is applied to $ \\alpha'_i $ to obtain the attention weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha'_{ij})}{\\sum_{k} \\exp(\\alpha'_{ik})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The output representation $o_i$ for the $i$-th element is computed as the weighted sum of the value vectors $v_j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "o_i = \\sum_{j} w_{ij} \\, v_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A self-attention layer takes an input $X$ of dimension $(T, D)$, where $T$ is the sequence length and $D$ is the input dimension. It then uses three linear projection matrices $W_K$, $W_Q$, and $W_V$ to obtain the keys, queries, and values, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "K &= X W_K, \\quad \\text{dimensions } (T \\times d_k) \\\\\n",

    "V &= X W_V, \\quad \\text{dimensions } (T \\times d_v)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot products between the queries and keys can grow large in magnitude when $d_k$ is high. Dividing by $\\sqrt{d_k}$ prevents these values from becoming too large, which helps stabilize gradients during training and ensures that the softmax function does not enter regions with extremely small gradients. (Recall that softmax input taking too low/high values leads to small gradients)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output $o_i$ from the attention layer becomes the input to the next layer, which allows to build higher-level representations in the deeper layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now complete the following **dot_product_SA** function to implement the self-attention mechanism."
